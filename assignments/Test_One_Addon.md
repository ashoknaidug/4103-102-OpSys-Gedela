## Multi\*
#### **Define the following and give examples of each.**

####1.Multi-tasking :
  Multitasking  is defined in terms of operating system, in which multiple processes, also called tasks, can execute (i.e., run) on a single computer seemingly simultaneously and without interfering with each other.
####Example :
  The operating system is able to keep track of where you are in these tasks and go from one to the other without losing information.

####2. Multi-programming :
  Multiprogramming is the technique of running several programs at a time using timesharing creating logical parallelism.Helps in keeping several jobs in memory simultaneously.
####Example :
  Time shared systems

####3. Multi-processing :
  Multiprocessing refers to the hardware (i.e., the CPU units) rather than the software (i.e., running processes). If the underlying hardware provides more than one processor then that is multiprocessing.
####Example : 
  symmetric multiprocessing system

####4. Multi-threaded :
  Multithreading is an execution model that allows a single process to have multiple code segments (i.e., threads) run concurrently within the “context” of that process. You can think of threads as child processes that share the parent process resources but execute independently. Multiple threads of a single process can share the CPU in a single CPU system or (purely) run in parallel in a multiprocessing system
####Example : 
  Single and Multi threadprocessing
